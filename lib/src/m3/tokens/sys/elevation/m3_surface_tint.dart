/// {@template m3_tonal_color}
/// Internal utility class for Material Design 3 surface tint calculations.
///
/// This class implements the core tonal elevation system of Material Design 3,
/// where surfaces at different elevations receive varying amounts of surface
/// tint to indicate their relative depth. The tonal system is the primary
/// method for expressing elevation in Material Design 3, with shadows serving
/// as a complementary enhancement.
///
/// ## Material Design 3 Tonal System
///
/// The tonal elevation system works by blending a surface tint color
/// (typically the primary color) with the base surface color. Higher
/// elevations receive more tint, creating a visual hierarchy that
/// indicates relative depth and importance.
///
/// ## Tint Application Formula
///
/// The tint opacity is calculated using an exponential curve that provides
/// natural-feeling progression:
/// - **0dp**: No tint (pure surface color)
/// - **1-6dp**: Gradual tint increase (subtle depth indication)
/// - **8-24dp**: Enhanced tint (prominent elevation)
/// - **24dp+**: Maximum tint (critical elevation)
///
/// ## Integration with Theme System
///
/// The tonal color system integrates seamlessly with Flutter's theme system,
/// automatically extracting surface and surfaceTint colors from the current
/// ColorScheme and applying appropriate tinting based on elevation values.
///
/// **Internal Implementation**: This is a private utility used by the elevation
/// token system. External code should use [M3ElevationToken] extensions like
/// `surfaceColor(context)` or `calculateSurfaceColor()`.
///
/// Reference: https://m3.material.io/styles/elevation/applying-elevation
/// {@endtemplate}

  /// This method is a convenient wrapper around Flutter's
