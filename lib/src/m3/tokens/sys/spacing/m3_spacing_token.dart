/// Contract for Material Design 3 spacing tokens.
abstract interface class IM3SpacingToken implements IM3Token<double> {}

/// Material Design 3 spacing tokens based on a 4dp grid system.
///
/// This enum provides a comprehensive set of pre-defined, Material 3-compliant
/// spacing values based on a 4dp grid. Using these tokens ensures consistent
/// and rhythmic spacing throughout the UI, following the official Material
/// Design 3 spacing guidelines.
///
/// Each token represents a specific spacing value in density-independent
/// pixels (dp). The system is designed around 4dp increments for optimal
/// visual rhythm and consistency across different screen densities and
/// accessibility requirements.
///
/// ## Design Philosophy
///
/// The Material Design 3 spacing system is built on these principles:
/// - **Consistent rhythm**: 4dp base unit creates predictable patterns
/// - **Semantic naming**: Token names reflect size and common use cases
/// - **Scalable hierarchy**: Progressive spacing supports visual hierarchy
/// - **Accessibility ready**: Spacing meets touch target and readability standards
/// - **Cross-platform consistency**: Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop
///
/// ## Spacing Categories
///
/// ### Micro Spacing (4dp-12dp)
/// Fine-tuned spacing for component internal padding and tight layouts:
/// - `space4`: Minimal spacing, icon padding
/// - `space8`: Small component padding, button internals
/// - `space12`: Compact list item spacing, form element gaps
///
/// ### Standard Spacing (16dp-24dp)
/// Primary spacing for most interface components:
/// - `space16`: **Most common** - standard padding and margins
/// - `space20`: Medium spacing for related content groups
/// - `space24`: Large component margins, section spacing
///
/// ### Macro Spacing (28dp-64dp)
/// Larger spacing for layout structure and visual separation:
/// - `space28-40`: Major component spacing, feature separation
/// - `space48-64`: Layout section spacing, content area margins
///
/// ### Extended Spacing (72dp-128dp)
/// Wide-screen and desktop layout spacing:
/// - `space72-96`: Large screen content margins
/// - `space128`: Maximum spacing for wide layouts
///
/// ## Usage Examples
///
/// ```dart
/// // Basic spacing
/// double spacing = M3SpacingToken.space16.value; // 16.0
///
/// // Component padding
/// Padding(
///   padding: EdgeInsets.all(M3SpacingToken.space16.value),
///   child: Text('Content'),
/// )
///
/// // Layout margins
/// Container(
///   margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(
///     horizontal: M3SpacingToken.space24.value,
///     vertical: M3SpacingToken.space16.value,
///   ),
/// )
///
/// // With Material Design 3 utilities
/// M3Padding(
///   padding: M3EdgeInsets.all(M3SpacingToken.space16),
///   child: content,
/// )
///
/// // Gap widgets
/// Column(
///   children: [
///     widget1,
///     M3Gap(M3SpacingToken.space12),
///     widget2,
///   ],
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Responsive Considerations
///
/// Different spacing may be appropriate for different screen sizes:
/// ```dart
/// // Responsive spacing selection
/// final spacing = screenWidth > 600
///     ? M3SpacingToken.space24  // Tablet/desktop
///     : M3SpacingToken.space16; // Mobile
/// ```
///
/// ## Best Practices
///
/// 1. **Start with space16** - Most common spacing value
/// 2. **Use semantic tokens** - Choose based on content relationship
/// 3. **Maintain rhythm** - Stick to 4dp multiples
/// 4. **Consider accessibility** - Ensure adequate touch targets
/// 5. **Test across devices** - Verify spacing works on different screens
