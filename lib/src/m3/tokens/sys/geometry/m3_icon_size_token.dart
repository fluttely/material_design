/// Material Design 3 icon size tokens for consistent iconography.
///
/// This enum defines standard icon sizes based on the Material Design 3
/// specification. While M3 primarily uses 24dp as the standard size for UI
/// icons,
/// different sizes are used contextually to maintain visual balance, hierarchy,
/// and optimal readability across various components and layouts.
///
/// The icon size system ensures consistent visual weight and proportions
/// throughout the interface, supporting both functional and decorative icon
/// usage.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// // Get standard icon size
/// double iconSize = M3IconSizeToken.standard.value; // 24.0
///
/// // Use in Icon widgets
/// Icon(
///   Icons.home,
///   size: M3IconSizeToken.standard.value,
/// )
///
/// // Use with IconButton
/// IconButton(
///   iconSize: M3IconSizeToken.medium.value,
///   onPressed: () {},
///   icon: Icon(Icons.settings),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Size Guidelines
///
/// - **Dense (20dp)**: Compact layouts, dense lists, chips
/// - **Standard (24dp)**: Default UI icons, buttons, navigation
/// - **Medium (32dp)**: Prominent icons, enhanced visibility
/// - **Large (40dp)**: Display icons, dialogs, empty states
/// - **Extra Large (48dp)**: Key visual elements, avatars
///
