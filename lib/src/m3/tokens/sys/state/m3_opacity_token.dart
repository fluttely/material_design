/// Material Design 3 general opacity tokens for UI elements.
///
/// This enum defines general-purpose opacity values for UI elements like
/// disabled components, dividers, and backdrops, following Material Design 3
/// guidelines. These opacities are typically applied directly to element
/// colors,
/// unlike state layers which are overlaid on top of components.
///
/// The opacity system ensures consistent visual hierarchy and accessibility
/// compliance across different component states and UI element types.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// // Get disabled content opacity
/// double opacity = M3OpacityToken.disabledContent.value; // 0.38
///
/// // Apply to disabled text
/// Text(
///   'Disabled Text',
///   style: TextStyle(
///     color: Colors.black.withValues(alpha:
///       M3OpacityToken.disabledContent.value,
///     ),
///   ),
/// )
///
/// // Use for disabled containers
/// Container(
///   decoration: M3BoxDecoration(
///     color: Colors.blue.withValues(alpha:
///       M3OpacityToken.disabledContainer.value,
///     ),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Opacity Guidelines
///
/// - **Disabled Content (38%)**: Text and icons in disabled state
/// - **Disabled Container (12%)**: Container backgrounds when disabled
/// - **Divider (12%)**: Subtle separation elements
/// - **Backdrop (50%)**: Modal backdrops and scrims
///
/// Reference: Material Design 3 accessibility and component guidelines
