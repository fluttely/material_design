/// Defines the visual density of user interface components.
///
/// Density, in the context of a UI, is the vertical and horizontal
/// "compactness" of the components in the UI. It is unitless, since it means
/// different things to different UI components.
///
/// The default for visual densities is zero for both vertical and horizontal
/// densities, which corresponds to the default visual density of components in
/// the Material Design specification. It does not affect text sizes, icon
/// sizes, or padding values.
///
/// For example, for buttons, it affects the spacing around the child of the
/// button. For lists, it affects the distance between baselines of entries in
/// the list. For chips, it only affects the vertical size, not the horizontal
/// size.
///
/// Here are some examples of widgets that respond to density changes:
///
///  * [Checkbox]
///  * [Chip]
///  * [ElevatedButton]
///  * [IconButton]
///  * [InputDecorator] (which gives density support to [TextField], etc.)
///  * [ListTile]
///  * [MaterialButton]
///  * [OutlinedButton]
///  * [Radio]
///  * [RawMaterialButton]
///  * [TextButton]
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ThemeData.visualDensity], where this property is used to specify the base
///    horizontal density of Material components.
///  * [Material design guidance on density](https://material.io/design/layout/applying-density.html).
