/// Material Design 3 [RoundedRectangleBorder] shapes for consistent component styling.
///
/// This class provides pre-configured [RoundedRectangleBorder] shapes that
/// implement Material Design 3's shape system. These shapes are ready to use
/// with Flutter widgets that accept [ShapeBorder] parameters, such as
/// [Material], [Card], [Button] variants, and custom containers.
///
/// Each shape uses [M3BorderRadius] values to ensure consistency with the
/// Material Design 3 specification while providing convenient access for
/// component styling and theming operations.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// // Apply shape to Material widget
/// Material(
///   shape: M3Shape.medium,
///   color: Colors.blue,
///   child: content,
/// )
///
/// // Use with Card widget
/// Card(
///   shape: M3Shape.large,
///   child: content,
/// )
///
/// // Apply to custom buttons
/// ElevatedButton(
///   style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
///     shape: M3Shape.small,
///   ),
///   onPressed: () {},
///   child: Text('Button'),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Component Integration
///
/// These shapes integrate seamlessly with Flutter's theming system:
///
/// ```dart
/// // Apply globally through theme
/// MaterialApp(
///   theme: ThemeData(
///     cardTheme: CardTheme(shape: M3Shape.medium),
///     elevatedButtonTheme: ElevatedButtonThemeData(
///       style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(shape: M3Shape.small),
///     ),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance
///
/// All shapes are compile-time constants, ensuring optimal performance
/// with no runtime allocation overhead.
///
/// Reference: https://m3.material.io/foundations/shape/shape-scale

  /// data displays, and components where corner rounding would interfere
  /// with functionality.

  /// Extra large rounded rectangular shape (28dp corners).
  ///
  /// Creates distinctive shapes for hero sections, large modal surfaces,
  /// bottom sheets, and prominent brand elements.
  static const extraLarge = M3Shape(borderRadius: M3BorderRadius.extraLarge);

  /// Extra large increased rounded rectangular shape (32dp corners).
  ///
  /// Maximum discrete shape for special emphasis components and
  /// brand-specific interface elements requiring strong visual impact.
  static const extraLargeIncreased =
      M3Shape(borderRadius: M3BorderRadius.extraLargeIncreased);

  /// Extra extra large rounded rectangular shape (48dp corners).
  ///
  /// The largest discrete shape value, reserved for unique creative
  /// elements and scenarios requiring maximum visual emphasis.
  static const extraExtraLarge =
      M3Shape(borderRadius: M3BorderRadius.extraExtraLarge);

  /// Fully rounded pill shape.
  ///
  /// Creates shapes with fully rounded ends that adapt to component
  /// dimensions. Perfect for floating action buttons, pill buttons,
  /// and search bars.
  static const full = M3Shape(borderRadius: M3BorderRadius.full);
