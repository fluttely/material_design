/// Defines the canonical Material Design 3 breakpoints, known as "window size classes".
///
/// These values are not arbitrary; they are based on extensive research by Google
/// on the most common screen sizes across the device ecosystem. They function
/// as lower bounds that categorize the available UI space, allowing layouts
/// to adapt consistently and ergonomically.
///
/// The goal is to ensure the application provides the best possible user experience,
/// whether on a small phone or an ultra-wide monitor.
