/// Material Design 3 Reference Tokens Export.
///
/// This barrel file exports all reference token definitions for the
/// Material Design 3 system. Reference tokens are the foundational
/// values that define colors, typography, and other design primitives.
///
/// Reference tokens are the lowest level in the token hierarchy:
/// ref -> sys -> comp
///
/// They provide the base values that system tokens use to create
/// semantic color roles, typography scales, and other design system
/// components.
