/// A comprehensive toolkit for implementing Material Design 3 in Flutter.
///
/// This library provides a set of pre-defined tokens and utilities that align
/// with the official Material 3 specification, making it easier to build
/// beautiful and consistent user interfaces.
///
/// To use the tokens, simply import this file:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:material_design/material_design.dart';
/// ```
///
/// Then, you can access all the tokens, such as:
/// - `M3TextStyle.headlineLarge`
/// - `M3ElevationToken.level5`
