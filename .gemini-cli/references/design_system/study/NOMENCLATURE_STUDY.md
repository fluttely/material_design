# Nomenclature Study

This document analyzes the nomenclature used in the `material_toolkit_research` project and provides suggestions for improvement. The goal is to establish a clear, consistent, and predictable naming convention that aligns with Dart best practices and enhances code readability and maintainability.

## General Principles

- **Clarity over Brevity:** Names should be descriptive and unambiguous, even if it means they are slightly longer.
- **Consistency:** Use the same naming patterns across the entire project.
- **Predictability:** Developers should be able to guess the name of a class, method, or variable based on its purpose.
- **Adherence to Dart Conventions:** Follow the official [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).

## Analysis and Suggestions

### 1. `DesignTokens` vs. `ToolkitTokens`

- **Current:** `DesignTokens`
- **Suggestion:** `ToolkitTokens`
- **Reasoning:** The name `DesignTokens` is generic and could refer to any design system. Since this is part of a "Material Toolkit," `ToolkitTokens` is more specific and clearly ties the tokens to this particular package.

### 2. `DesignProvider` vs. `ToolkitProvider`

- **Current:** `DesignProvider`
- **Suggestion:** `ToolkitProvider`
- **Reasoning:** Similar to the reasoning for `DesignTokens`, this change makes the provider's name more specific to the toolkit.

### 3. `redius_tokens_data.dart` vs. `radius_tokens_data.dart`

- **Current:** `redius_tokens_data.dart`
- **Suggestion:** `radius_tokens_data.dart`
- **Reasoning:** This is a simple typo correction.

### 4. `Design...` Prefix for Resolvers and Data Classes

- **Current:** `DesignBorderRadius`, `DesignRadius`, `DesignOutlineInputBorder`, etc.
- **Suggestion:** Remove the `Design` prefix.
- **Reasoning:** The `Design` prefix is redundant. These classes are already part of the toolkit's design system, so the prefix adds unnecessary verbosity. For example, `DesignBorderRadius` can be simplified to `ToolkitBorderRadius` or just `BorderRadiusConfig` if we want to be more specific about its purpose. However, since these are part of the `material_toolkit` library, a simple `BorderRadius` might conflict with Flutter's own `BorderRadius`. A good alternative would be to use the `Toolkit` prefix, like `ToolkitBorderRadius`.

### 5. `...TokensData` Suffix

- **Current:** `BorderWidthTokensData`, `BreakpointTokensData`, `ElevationTokensData`, etc.
- **Suggestion:** `...Tokens`
- **Reasoning:** The `Data` suffix is redundant. It's clear from the context that these classes hold token data. Simplifying to `BorderWidthTokens`, `BreakpointTokens`, etc., makes the names shorter and more concise.

### 6. `Material...` Prefix for Abstract Classes

- **Current:** `MaterialElevation`, `MaterialIconSize`, `MaterialRadius`, `MaterialSpacing`
- **Suggestion:** `...Defaults` or `...Values`
- **Reasoning:** The `Material` prefix is good for indicating that these are based on Material Design, but the names don't clearly indicate that they are providing default or constant values. `MaterialElevationDefaults` or `ElevationValues` would be more descriptive.

### 7. `AdaptiveWidget`

- **Current:** `AdaptiveWidget`
- **Suggestion:** This name is good, but the implementation could be improved. Instead of a `StatefulWidget` with a `build` method that checks the platform, this could be a `StatelessWidget` that takes builders for each platform as constructor arguments. This would make it more flexible and easier to use.

### 8. `resolvers` Directory

- **Current:** `resolvers`
- **Suggestion:** This is a good name for the directory, as it clearly indicates that the classes within are responsible for resolving token values into concrete Flutter objects.

## Summary of Proposed Changes

| Current Name | Suggested Name | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DesignTokens` | `ToolkitTokens` | More specific to the toolkit. |
| `DesignProvider` | `ToolkitProvider` | More specific to the toolkit. |
| `redius_tokens_data.dart` | `radius_tokens_data.dart` | Typo correction. |
| `DesignBorderRadius` | `ToolkitBorderRadius` | Removes redundant prefix and adds toolkit specificity. |
| `BorderWidthTokensData` | `BorderWidthTokens` | Removes redundant suffix. |
| `MaterialElevation` | `ElevationValues` | More descriptive of the class's purpose. |
| `AdaptiveWidget` | (Keep name, change implementation) | Improve flexibility and ease of use. |

By adopting these suggestions, the project's nomenclature will be more consistent, predictable, and easier to understand for both new and existing developers.
