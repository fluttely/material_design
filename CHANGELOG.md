## 0.7.0

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Tokens:** The Material 3 token system has been completely refactored for better organization and clarity.
  - System tokens are now organized under `lib/src/m3/tokens/sys/`. This includes `Color`, `Elevation`, `Motion`, `Shape`, `Spacing`, and `Typography`.
  - Many token files have been moved, renamed, or consolidated. Please refer to the updated documentation for the new token structure.
  - The `M3Theme` class has been removed as part of this refactoring.

### Features

- **Components:** Added a new Material 3 Button component (`M3CompButton`).
- **Tokens:** Introduced new system tokens for `Elevation`, `Motion`, `Shape`, `Spacing`, and `StateLayerOpacity`.

### Refactor

- Refactored the entire token system to align more closely with the official Material Design 3 specifications.
- Renamed and moved several internal utilities and classes to a new `mt` (Material Toolkit) namespace for better internal structure.
- Updated the example application to reflect all the latest changes and new APIs.
- Renamed the "Density" showcase page to "Visual Density" for clarity.

### Chores

- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude new generated files.
- Updated `README.md` with the latest information.

## 0.6.2

### Major Refactoring: Token System Overhaul

- **Shape System**: Replaced `BoxDecoration` with `ShapeDecoration` across the example app for better semantics. Introduced `M3BorderRadius` and converted `M3Radius` from `double` to `Radius` constants, providing a more robust and type-safe way to define shapes.
- **Motion Tokens**: Consolidated motion-related tokens. `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` have been merged into a single, more organized `m3_motion.dart` file under the `sys` directory, improving clarity and discoverability.
- **File Structure**: Reorganized the token file structure to better align with the Material Design 3 system. Legacy and unused token files like `M3ColorRoles`, `m3_radius.dart` (the old `double` based one), and `m3_examples.dart` have been removed to streamline the package.

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed `M3ColorRoles`**: The static `M3ColorRoles` class has been removed. Please use the color scheme provided by the `M3Theme` or `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for semantic color access.
- **Removed `M3Radius` (as `double`)**: The `M3Radius` class that provided `double` values has been replaced by `M3BorderRadius` (which provides `BorderRadius` objects) and a new `M3Radius` class that provides `Radius` objects.
- **Consolidated Motion Tokens**: `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` are no longer separate files. Import `package:material_design/material_design.dart` and use the `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` classes directly.

### Enhancements & Fixes

- **Code Cleanup**: Performed a general code cleanup, removing obsolete files and refactoring the example app for better readability and consistency.
- **Shape Implementation**: Consistently replaced `BorderRadius.circular()` with the new `M3BorderRadius` constants throughout the example app.
- **New `md` Module**: Introduced a new `md` module for future development, starting with a new barrel file `md.dart`.

## 0.6.1

- **Internationalized Example App**: All user-facing strings in the accessibility showcase are now in English, making the example more accessible to a global audience.
- **Code Cleanup**: Minor code cleanup and refactoring in the example app for better readability and maintenance.

## 0.6.0

### New Features

- **Complete M3 Theme System**: Introduced `M3Theme`, an integrated theme builder that generates a complete `ThemeData` from a seed color, with full support for light, dark, and high-contrast modes.
- **Comprehensive Accessibility Utilities**: Added the `M3Accessibility` class, providing a suite of tools for building WCAG-compliant UIs, including accessible form fields, focus indicators, contrast checking, and touch target enforcement.
- **Adaptive Design System**: Implemented the `M3Adaptive` class with helpers for responsive layouts (`M3Adaptive.responsiveLayout`), adaptive navigation (`M3AdaptiveScaffold`), and adaptive components that adjust to different screen sizes and platforms.
- **Advanced Token Utilities**: Added new utility classes for enhanced token functionality:
  - `M3TypeScale`: Responsive and accessible typography helpers.
  - `M3ColorUtils`: Color manipulation and contrast validation.
  - `M3ShapeUtils`: Responsive and brand-specific shape generation.
  - `M3MotionUtils`: Contextual animation patterns (fade, slide, scale).

### Breaking Changes

- **Token Architecture Refactor**: The entire token system has been restructured to follow the official Material Design 3 hierarchy:
  - **Reference Tokens (Ref)**: Foundational values (e.g., `M3RefPalette`, `M3RefDuration`).
  - **System Tokens (Sys)**: Semantic roles (e.g., `M3SysColor`).
  - **Component Tokens (Comp)**: Component-specific values (e.g., `M3CompButton`).
- The old token structure is now considered legacy and will be deprecated in a future version.

### Enhancements & Fixes
