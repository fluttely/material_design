## 0.18.0

### üîÑ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Token System Overhaul**: Major architectural refactoring of the entire token system. Raw token values have been moved into dedicated `abstract final` classes (e.g., `M3Elevations`, `M3Spacings`, `M3Shapes`), and token `enum`s now reference these constants. This improves code organization, type safety, and maintainability but alters the internal structure.
- **`M3StateLayerToken` Deprecated**: The `M3StateLayerToken` enum and its corresponding file have been commented out and are no longer part of the public API. State layers should now be constructed manually using `M3StateLayerOpacities` and theme colors.
- **Removed Shape Helpers**: Static helper methods `M3ShapeToken.forComponentSize()` and `M3ShapeToken.forComponent()` have been removed.
- **Removed Shape Extensions**: The `M3ShapeExtensions` (`withShape`, `clipWithShape`) have been removed.
- **New `IM3ContextualToken` Interface**: Introduced `IM3ContextualToken` for tokens whose values depend on `BuildContext`. `M3SurfaceColorToken` now implements this interface, changing its `value` from a method to a getter that returns a `Color Function(BuildContext)`.

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Refinements

- **Centralized Token Constants**: Introduced dedicated classes to hold raw, `const` token values (`M3Elevations`, `M3Spacings`, `M3Shapes`, `M3Radii`, `M3BorderRadii`, `M3VisualDensities`, `M3MotionDurations`, `M3MotionCurves`, `M3Opacities`, `M3StateLayerOpacities`, `M3TextStyles`). This provides a single source of truth and allows for direct access to primitive values when needed.
- **Simplified Token Enums**: All token `enum`s (`M3ElevationToken`, `M3SpacingToken`, etc.) have been simplified to act as semantic wrappers around the new constant value classes.
- **Improved `M3VisualDensityToken`**: The implementation has been significantly streamlined. It now directly holds a `VisualDensity` object instead of separate `horizontal` and `vertical` properties, simplifying its API and improving its integration with Flutter's core density system.

### üéØ Developer Experience Improvements

- **Enhanced API Consistency**: The refactoring provides a more consistent and predictable API. Developers can now access either the semantic token `enum` or the raw `const` value from the new static classes.
- **Improved Type Safety**: The new structure enhances type safety and reduces the chances of using "magic numbers" throughout the codebase.

### üîß Migration Guide

**`M3VisualDensityToken` Usage:**

The API for adaptive density is now a direct static getter.

```dart
// Before (v0.17.0)
VisualDensity adaptive = M3VisualDensityToken.adaptivePlatform.value;

// After (v0.18.0)
VisualDensity adaptive = M3VisualDensityToken.adaptivePlatformDensity;
```

**State Layer Creation:**

Since `M3StateLayerToken` is gone, state layers must be created manually using `M3StateLayerOpacities`.

```dart
// Before (v0.17.0)
Color hoverOverlay = M3StateLayerToken.hoverPrimary.withBaseColor(Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary);

// After (v0.18.0)
Color hoverOverlay = Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary.withOpacity(M3StateLayerOpacities.hover);
```

**`M3SurfaceColorToken` Usage:**

The public-facing usage remains the same, but the underlying interface has changed from a method `value(context)` to a getter `value` that returns a function.

```dart
// Usage remains the same, but be aware of the interface change if you were implementing it.
Color surfaceColor = M3SurfaceColorToken.level1.value(context);
```

### üìä Impact Summary

- **Files Modified**: 20+ files updated across the core library and tests.
- **Architectural Refinement**: Major improvement in token system architecture for long-term maintainability.
- **API Simplification**: Removed several APIs (`M3StateLayerToken`, shape helpers) in favor of a more direct, foundational approach.

  - **`M3Gap` Widget**: A token-based replacement for `SizedBox` to create consistent spacing in `Row`s and `Column`s using `M3SpacingToken`.
- **Simplified Token API**: The API for all spacing and margin tokens has been simplified. The `.value` accessor is no longer needed when using the new spacing widgets and utilities, making the code cleaner and more readable (e.g., `M3Padding.all(M3SpacingToken.space16)`).
- **Enhanced Breakpoint System**: The responsive breakpoint system has been refactored for clarity and consistency.
  - `M3WindowSizeClass` has been renamed to `M3ScreenSize`.
  - `getWindowSizeClassFromContext` has been renamed to `getScreenSizeFromContext`.
- **Improved Documentation**:
  - The main library file (`m3.dart`) has been completely overhauled with comprehensive documentation, serving as a complete guide to the package's features.
  - All core token classes (`M3ElevationToken`, `M3VisualDensityToken`, `IM3Token`, etc.) have received extensive inline documentation, explaining their purpose, architecture, and usage patterns.

### üîÑ Refactoring

- **Full Adoption of New Spacing System**: The entire demo application, examples, and internal library code have been refactored to use the new `M3EdgeInsets`, `M3Padding`, and `M3Gap` utilities. This removes direct dependencies on Flutter's `Padding` and `SizedBox`, ensuring strict adherence to the design system.
- **Adaptive Utilities Update**: The `M3Adaptive` helper class has been updated to use the new `M3ScreenSize` enum and `M3EdgeInsets` utility for responsive layouts.
- **Codebase Cleanup**: Removed unused files and cleaned up `.gitignore`.

### üîß Migration Guide

**Spacing and Padding:**

Update all `Padding` and `SizedBox` widgets used for spacing to the new `M3Padding` and `M3Gap` widgets.

**Before (v0.11.0):**

```dart
Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(M3SpacingToken.space16.value),
  child: Text('Hello'),
)

SizedBox(height: M3SpacingToken.space24.value)
```

**After (v0.12.0):**

```dart
M3Padding.all(
  M3SpacingToken.space16,
  child: Text('Hello'),
)

const M3Gap(M3SpacingToken.space24)
```

**Responsive Breakpoints:**

Update all references from `M3WindowSizeClass` to `M3ScreenSize`.

**Before (v0.11.0):**

```dart
final sizeClass = M3BreakpointToken.getWindowSizeClassFromContext(context);
if (sizeClass == M3WindowSizeClass.compact) {
  // ...
}
```

**After (v0.12.0):**

```dart
final screenSize = M3BreakpointToken.getScreenSizeFromContext(context);
if (screenSize == M3ScreenSize.compact) {
  // ...
}
```

## 0.11.0

### New Features

- **Introduced `M3Padding` Widget**: A new token-driven widget that replaces the standard `Padding` to enforce the use of `M3SpacingToken` for consistent padding across the application. It provides convenient constructors like `M3Padding.all`, `M3Padding.only`, and `M3Padding.symmetric`.
- **Introduced `M3Gap` Widget**: A direct, token-based replacement for `SizedBox` used for creating space between widgets. `M3Gap` simplifies creating consistent spacing in `Row`s and `Column`s by using `M3SpacingToken`.
- **Introduced `M3EdgeInsets` Utility**: A new utility class to create `EdgeInsets` exclusively from `M3SpacingToken`, ensuring all spacing values adhere to the Material Design system's defined scale.

### Refactoring

- **Adopted New Spacing Widgets**: Refactored the entire demo application, examples, and internal library widgets to use the new `M3Padding` and `M3Gap` widgets. This removes direct dependency on Flutter's `Padding` and `SizedBox` for spacing tasks, promoting design system consistency.
- **Simplified Token API**: Updated the API for spacing tokens. It's no longer necessary to call `.value` on tokens when using them with the new spacing widgets (e.g., `M3Padding.all(M3SpacingToken.space16)`).
- **Improved Code Organization**: Relocated core utility files from the `lib/src/m3/mt/` directory to a more semantically correct `lib/src/m3/utils/` directory, improving the project's structure.

### Documentation

- **Updated All Examples**: Revised all documentation, including `README.md`, implementation guides, and inline code comments, to reflect the new spacing widgets and strongly recommend their usage over standard Flutter widgets for spacing.

## 0.10.0

### üí• BREAKING CHANGES

- **Major Token System Refactor**: The token system has been significantly refactored to improve consistency, remove redundancy, and align more closely with a unified design system architecture.
  - **Unified Shape Tokens**: `M3BorderRadiusToken` and `M3RadiusToken` are now internal (`_M3BorderRadiusToken`, `_M3RadiusToken`). All shape properties should be accessed directly through `M3ShapeToken`.
    - **Before**: `M3BorderRadiusToken.medium.value`
    - **After**: `M3ShapeToken.medium.borderRadius`
  - **Screen Size Enum Renamed**: `M3WindowSizeClass` has been renamed to `M3ScreenSize` for better clarity and to avoid conflicts with Flutter's own window size classes.
  - **Private Component/State Tokens**: `M3ComponentElevationToken` and `M3StateElevationToken` have been made private (`_M3ComponentElevationToken`, `_M3StateElevationToken`) as they are intended for internal use within the system.
  - **Simplified Motion API**: `M3MotionToken` now includes `duration` and `easing` getters, simplifying animation definitions.

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- **Improved API Consistency**: The token API is now more consistent and predictable. Accessing related values (like radius from a shape) is more intuitive.
- **Streamlined Architecture**: By removing redundant and reference-level tokens, the public API is smaller, cleaner, and easier to learn.
- **Enhanced Readability**: The new patterns (`M3ShapeToken.medium.borderRadius`) make the code more declarative and easier to read.

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecations & Removals

- **Removed Reference Tokens**: The `M3Ref...` token files (`M3RefPalette`, `M3RefOpacity`, `M3RefTypeface`) have been removed from the public API. Their values are now integrated directly into the system tokens where needed.
- **Removed Component-Specific Button Tokens**: `M3CompButton` has been removed. Use standard Flutter `ButtonStyle` with system tokens for customization.
- **Removed `M3ColorSchemeToken`**: This has been removed as part of the color system simplification. Use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for semantic color access.
- **Removed Demo Component Showcase**: The `components_showcase_page.dart` file has been deleted from the demo application as part of a broader demo simplification effort.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Tokens:** The Material 3 token system has been completely refactored for better organization and clarity.
  - System tokens are now organized under `lib/src/m3/tokens/sys/`. This includes `Color`, `Elevation`, `Motion`, `Shape`, `Spacing`, and `Typography`.
  - Many token files have been moved, renamed, or consolidated. Please refer to the updated documentation for the new token structure.
  - The `M3Theme` class has been removed as part of this refactoring.

### Features

- **Components:** Added a new Material 3 Button component (`M3CompButton`).
- **Tokens:** Introduced new system tokens for `Elevation`, `Motion`, `Shape`, `Spacing`, and `StateLayerOpacity`.

## 0.6.2

### Major Refactoring: Token System Overhaul

- **Shape System**: Replaced `BoxDecoration` with `ShapeDecoration` across the example app for better semantics. Introduced `M3BorderRadius` and converted `M3Radius` from `double` to `Radius` constants, providing a more robust and type-safe way to define shapes.
- **Motion Tokens**: Consolidated motion-related tokens. `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` have been merged into a single, more organized `m3_motion.dart` file under the `sys` directory, improving clarity and discoverability.
- **File Structure**: Reorganized the token file structure to better align with the Material Design 3 system. Legacy and unused token files like `M3ColorRoles`, `m3_radius.dart` (the old `double` based one), and `m3_examples.dart` have been removed to streamline the package.

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed `M3ColorRoles`**: The static `M3ColorRoles` class has been removed. Please use the color scheme provided by the `M3Theme` or `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for semantic color access.
- **Removed `M3Radius` (as `double`)**: The `M3Radius` class that provided `double` values has been replaced by `M3BorderRadius` (which provides `BorderRadius` objects) and a new `M3Radius` class that provides `Radius` objects.
- **Consolidated Motion Tokens**: `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` are no longer separate files. Import `package:material_design/material_design.dart` and use the `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` classes directly.

### Enhancements & Fixes

- **Code Cleanup**: Performed a general code cleanup, removing obsolete files and refactoring the example app for better readability and consistency.
- **Shape Implementation**: Consistently replaced `BorderRadius.circular()` with the new `M3BorderRadius` constants throughout the example app.
- **New `md` Module**: Introduced a new `md` module for future development, starting with a new barrel file `md.dart`.
