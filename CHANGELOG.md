### üí• BREAKING CHANGES: Massive Project Restructuring and API Refinement

This release introduces a massive architectural overhaul, reorganizing the entire project structure for improved clarity, maintainability, and scalability. The directory structure has been flattened, and many files and classes have been renamed to create a more intuitive and consistent developer experience.

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Overhaul

- **Flattened Directory Structure**: The deeply nested token, widget, and utility directories (`lib/src/m3/tokens/sys`, `lib/src/m3/widgets`, `lib/src/m3/utils`) have been consolidated into a flatter, more domain-centric structure under `lib/src/m3/`.
  - **Before**: `lib/src/m3/tokens/sys/geometry/m3_border_token.dart`
  - **After**: `lib/src/m3/border/m3_border_token.dart`
- **Domain-Driven Organization**: Files are now grouped by domain (e.g., `border`, `color`, `elevation`, `shape`, `spacing`) rather than by type (token, widget, util). This makes it easier to locate related files.
- **M3 Expressive Renaming**: The `m3_expressive` directory has been shortened to `m3e` for brevity.
  - `LoadingIndicator` is now `M3ELoadingIndicator`.
  - `material_shapes.dart` is now `e_shapes.dart`.

### üéØ API Refinements

- **`M3CornersToken` -> `M3CornerToken`**: The enum for corner tokens has been renamed to the singular form for consistency.
- **`M3Border.all`**: The factory constructor is now private (`_all`), and static constants (`thin`, `thick`) should be used instead.

### üîß Migration Guide

**File Imports:**
Your `part of` directives and imports will need to be updated to reflect the new, flatter file structure.

**M3 Expressive Loading Indicator:**

```dart
// Before (v0.23.0-dev)
import 'package:material_design/src/m3_expressive/loading_indicator/loading_indicator.dart';
LoadingIndicator()

// After (v0.24.0)
import 'package:material_design/src/m3e/e_loading_indicator/e_loading_indicator.dart';
M3ELoadingIndicator()
```

**Corner Radius Tokens:**

```dart
// Before (v0.23.0-dev)
M3Radius.circular(M3CornersToken.small)

// After (v0.24.0)
M3Radius.circular(M3CornerToken.small)
```

**Borders:**

```dart
// Before (v0.23.0-dev)
const M3Border.all(M3BorderSide.thin)

// After (v0.24.0)
M3Border.thin
```

### üìä Impact Summary

## 0.23.0-dev

### üí• BREAKING CHANGES: Major Token System Refactoring and API Stabilization

This release marks a significant milestone in the library's evolution, introducing major breaking changes aimed at simplifying the API, improving type safety, and aligning more closely with Flutter's core conventions. The token system has been substantially refactored, removing the `Token` suffix from many classes and promoting direct class usage over enums.

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Refinements

- **Motion System Overhaul**:

  - **`M3MotionToken` -> `M3Motion`**: The composite motion token has been renamed.
  - **`M3MotionDurationToken` -> `M3MotionDuration`**: Now a class that extends `Duration`, providing direct access to duration constants (e.g., `M3MotionDuration.short2`).
  - **`M3MotionCurveToken` -> `M3MotionCurve`**: Now a class that extends `ThreePointCubic`, providing direct access to curve constants (e.g., `M3MotionCurve.standard`).
  - The `.value` accessor is no longer needed for motion durations and curves.

- **Visual Density System Refactoring**:

  - **`M3VisualDensityToken` -> `M3VisualDensity`**: The enum has been replaced with a class that extends `VisualDensity`, allowing for direct use in `ThemeData` without the `.value` accessor.
  - Provides static constants like `M3VisualDensity.compact` and `M3VisualDensity.comfortable`.

- **Elevation System Simplification**:

  - The `M3ElevationToken` API has been enhanced. The `surfaceColor(context)` and `shadows` getters are now part of the `IM3ElevationTokenVisuals` extension, providing a more unified way to get elevation effects.
  - `M3SurfaceColorToken` has been removed and its logic is now integrated directly into the elevation token.

- **Border System Unification**:

  - **`M3BorderToken` / `M3BorderSideToken` -> `M3Border` / `M3BorderSide`**: The token enums have been replaced by classes that extend `Border` and `BorderSide` respectively.
  - Border styles are now accessed via static constants like `M3Border.thin` and `M3BorderSide.thick`.

- **State Layer System Removal**:
  - `M3StateLayerToken.dart` has been deleted. State layer opacities should be handled using `M3StateLayerOpacities` combined with theme colors.

### üéØ Developer Experience Improvements

- **Simplified API**: The removal of the `Token` suffix and the `.value` accessor for many tokens results in cleaner, more readable, and more intuitive code.
- **Improved Type Safety**: Using classes that extend core Flutter types (`Duration`, `Curve`, `VisualDensity`, `Border`) enhances type safety and integration with Flutter's widget system.
- **API Alignment**: The new API aligns more closely with standard Flutter conventions, making it easier for developers to adopt.

## 0.21.0-dev

### üí• BREAKING CHANGES: Major Architectural Overhaul

This version introduces a major architectural refactoring of the token system to enhance type safety, simplify the API, and improve the overall developer experience. The token `enum` system has been replaced with direct `const` values and type-safe atomic wrapper classes.

- **Token API Overhaul**: All `M3...Token` enums (e.g., `M3ShapeToken`, `M3TextStyleToken`, `M3BorderRadiusToken`) have been removed from the public API or made private.
- **Direct `const` Access**: Token values are now accessed directly via `const` fields in new static classes (e.g., `M3Shapes.medium`, `M3TextStyle.bodyLarge`, `M3BorderRadii.small`). The `.value` accessor is no longer needed, resulting in cleaner and more performant code.
- **New Atomic Wrapper Classes**: Introduced new classes that extend Flutter's core layout classes to enforce the use of design tokens at the lowest level:
  - `M3TextStyle` extends `TextStyle`.
  - `M3Radius` extends `Radius`.
  - `M3BorderRadius` extends `BorderRadius`.
  - `M3BorderSide` extends `BorderSide`.
  - `M3RoundedRectangleBorder` extends `RoundedRectangleBorder`.
  - `M3BoxShadow` extends `BoxShadow`.
- **Class Renaming**: The `M3ShadowToken` enum has been replaced by the `M3Shadows` class, which provides direct access to shadow constants.

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Refinements

- **Atomic Design Principles**: The new atomic classes (`M3TextStyle`, `M3Radius`, etc.) enforce the design system at a more granular level, providing compile-time safety and preventing the use of arbitrary values.
- **API Simplification**: The API is now more intuitive and requires less boilerplate. Direct access to `const` values makes the code cleaner and more aligned with Flutter's core widgets.
- **Improved Type Safety**: The wrapper classes ensure that only valid Material Design tokens can be used, enhancing type safety and reducing potential runtime errors.

### üéØ Developer Experience Improvements

- **Simplified API**: Code is significantly cleaner and more readable (e.g., `shape: M3Shapes.medium` instead of `shape: M3ShapeToken.medium.value`).
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: The use of `const` values and strongly-typed classes provides better autocompletion and more reliable compile-time error checking in IDEs.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: The removal of the `.value` accessor and complex token chains reduces boilerplate and simplifies widget styling.

### üîß Migration Guide

**Shape Tokens:**
Update `M3ShapeToken.token.value` to the direct `M3Shapes.token` constant.

```dart
// Before
Card(shape: M3ShapeToken.large.value)

// After
Card(shape: M3Shapes.large)
```

**BorderRadius Tokens:**
Replace `M3BorderRadiusToken.token.value` with `M3BorderRadii.token`.

```dart
// Before
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    borderRadius: M3BorderRadiusToken.large.value,
  ),
)

// After
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    borderRadius: M3BorderRadii.large,
  ),
)
```

**TextStyle Tokens:**
Replace `M3TextStyleToken.token.value` with the direct `M3TextStyle.token` constant.

```dart
// Before
Text('Title', style: M3TextStyleToken.headlineMedium.value)

// After
Text('Title', style: M3TextStyle.headlineMedium)
```

**Elevation & Shadow Tokens:**
Update `M3ShadowToken.fromElevation(...)` to use the new `M3Shadows` class.

```dart
// Before
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    boxShadow: M3ShadowToken.fromElevation(M3ElevationToken.level3.value),
  ),
)

// After
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    boxShadow: M3Shadows.fromElevation(M3ElevationToken.level3.value),
  ),
)
```

## 0.18.0

### üîÑ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Token System Overhaul**: Major architectural refactoring of the entire token system. Raw token values have been moved into dedicated `abstract final` classes (e.g., `M3Elevations`, `M3Spacings`, `M3Shapes`), and token `enum`s now reference these constants. This improves code organization, type safety, and maintainability but alters the internal structure.
- **`M3StateLayerToken` Deprecated**: The `M3StateLayerToken` enum and its corresponding file have been commented out and are no longer part of the public API. State layers should now be constructed manually using `M3StateLayerOpacities` and theme colors.
- **Removed Shape Helpers**: Static helper methods `M3ShapeToken.forComponentSize()` and `M3ShapeToken.forComponent()` have been removed.
- **Removed Shape Extensions**: The `M3ShapeExtensions` (`withShape`, `clipWithShape`) have been removed.
- **New `IM3ContextualToken` Interface**: Introduced `IM3ContextualToken` for tokens whose values depend on `BuildContext`. `M3SurfaceColorToken` now implements this interface, changing its `value` from a method to a getter that returns a `Color Function(BuildContext)`.

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Refinements

- **Centralized Token Constants**: Introduced dedicated classes to hold raw, `const` token values (`M3Elevations`, `M3Spacings`, `M3Shapes`, `M3Radii`, `M3BorderRadii`, `M3VisualDensities`, `M3MotionDurations`, `M3MotionCurves`, `M3Opacities`, `M3StateLayerOpacities`, `M3TextStyles`). This provides a single source of truth and allows for direct access to primitive values when needed.
- **Simplified Token Enums**: All token `enum`s (`M3ElevationToken`, `M3SpacingToken`, etc.) have been simplified to act as semantic wrappers around the new constant value classes.
- **Improved `M3VisualDensityToken`**: The implementation has been significantly streamlined. It now directly holds a `VisualDensity` object instead of separate `horizontal` and `vertical` properties, simplifying its API and improving its integration with Flutter's core density system.

### üéØ Developer Experience Improvements

- **Enhanced API Consistency**: The refactoring provides a more consistent and predictable API. Developers can now access either the semantic token `enum` or the raw `const` value from the new static classes.
- **Improved Type Safety**: The new structure enhances type safety and reduces the chances of using "magic numbers" throughout the codebase.

### üîß Migration Guide

**`M3VisualDensityToken` Usage:**

The API for adaptive density is now a direct static getter.

```dart
// Before (v0.17.0)
VisualDensity adaptive = M3VisualDensityToken.adaptivePlatform.value;

// After (v0.18.0)
VisualDensity adaptive = M3VisualDensityToken.adaptivePlatformDensity;
```

**State Layer Creation:**

Since `M3StateLayerToken` is gone, state layers must be created manually using `M3StateLayerOpacities`.

```dart
// Before (v0.17.0)
Color hoverOverlay = M3StateLayerToken.hoverPrimary.withBaseColor(Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary);

// After (v0.18.0)
Color hoverOverlay = Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary.withOpacity(M3StateLayerOpacities.hover);
```

**`M3SurfaceColorToken` Usage:**

The public-facing usage remains the same, but the underlying interface has changed from a method `value(context)` to a getter `value` that returns a function.

```dart
// Usage remains the same, but be aware of the interface change if you were implementing it.
Color surfaceColor = M3SurfaceColorToken.level1.value(context);
```

### üìä Impact Summary

- **Files Modified**: 20+ files updated across the core library and tests.
- **Architectural Refinement**: Major improvement in token system architecture for long-term maintainability.
- **API Simplification**: Removed several APIs (`M3StateLayerToken`, shape helpers) in favor of a more direct, foundational approach.

Update all `Padding` and `SizedBox` widgets used for spacing to the new `M3Padding` and `M3Gap` widgets.

**Before (v0.11.0):**

```dart
Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(M3SpacingToken.space16.value),
  child: Text('Hello'),
)

SizedBox(height: M3SpacingToken.space24.value)
```

**After (v0.12.0):**

final screenSize = M3BreakpointToken.getScreenSizeFromContext(context);
if (screenSize == M3ScreenSize.compact) {
  // ...
}
```

## 0.11.0

### New Features

- **Introduced `M3Padding` Widget**: A new token-driven widget that replaces the standard `Padding` to enforce the use of `M3SpacingToken` for consistent padding across the application. It provides convenient constructors like `M3Padding.all`, `M3Padding.only`, and `M3Padding.symmetric`.
- **Introduced `M3Gap` Widget**: A direct, token-based replacement for `SizedBox` used for creating space between widgets. `M3Gap` simplifies creating consistent spacing in `Row`s and `Column`s by using `M3SpacingToken`.
- **Introduced `M3EdgeInsets` Utility**: A new utility class to create `EdgeInsets` exclusively from `M3SpacingToken`, ensuring all spacing values adhere to the Material Design system's defined scale.

### Refactoring

- **Adopted New Spacing Widgets**: Refactored the entire demo application, examples, and internal library widgets to use the new `M3Padding` and `M3Gap` widgets. This removes direct dependency on Flutter's `Padding` and `SizedBox` for spacing tasks, promoting design system consistency.
- **Simplified Token API**: Updated the API for spacing tokens. It's no longer necessary to call `.value` on tokens when using them with the new spacing widgets (e.g., `M3Padding.all(M3SpacingToken.space16)`).
- **Improved Code Organization**: Relocated core utility files from the `lib/src/m3/mt/` directory to a more semantically correct `lib/src/m3/utils/` directory, improving the project's structure.

### Documentation

- **Updated All Examples**: Revised all documentation, including `README.md`, implementation guides, and inline code comments, to reflect the new spacing widgets and strongly recommend their usage over standard Flutter widgets for spacing.

## 0.10.0

### üí• BREAKING CHANGES

- **Major Token System Refactor**: The token system has been significantly refactored to improve consistency, remove redundancy, and align more closely with a unified design system architecture.
  - **Unified Shape Tokens**: `M3BorderRadiusToken` and `M3RadiusToken` are now internal (`_M3BorderRadiusToken`, `_M3RadiusToken`). All shape properties should be accessed directly through `M3ShapeToken`.
    - **Before**: `M3BorderRadiusToken.medium.value`
    - **After**: `M3ShapeToken.medium.borderRadius`
  - **Screen Size Enum Renamed**: `M3WindowSizeClass` has been renamed to `M3ScreenSize` for better clarity and to avoid conflicts with Flutter's own window size classes.
  - **Private Component/State Tokens**: `M3ComponentElevationToken` and `M3StateElevationToken` have been made private (`_M3ComponentElevationToken`, `_M3StateElevationToken`) as they are intended for internal use within the system.
  - **Simplified Motion API**: `M3MotionToken` now includes `duration` and `easing` getters, simplifying animation definitions.

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- **Improved API Consistency**: The token API is now more consistent and predictable. Accessing related values (like radius from a shape) is more intuitive.
- **Streamlined Architecture**: By removing redundant and reference-level tokens, the public API is smaller, cleaner, and easier to learn.
- **Enhanced Readability**: The new patterns (`M3ShapeToken.medium.borderRadius`) make the code more declarative and easier to read.

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecations & Removals

- **Removed Reference Tokens**: The `M3Ref...` token files (`M3RefPalette`, `M3RefOpacity`, `M3RefTypeface`) have been removed from the public API. Their values are now integrated directly into the system tokens where needed.
- **Removed Component-Specific Button Tokens**: `M3CompButton` has been removed. Use standard Flutter `ButtonStyle` with system tokens for customization.
- **Removed `M3ColorSchemeToken`**: This has been removed as part of the color system simplification. Use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for semantic color access.
- **Removed Demo Component Showcase**: The `components_showcase_page.dart` file has been deleted from the demo application as part of a broader demo simplification effort.

## 0.6.2

### Major Refactoring: Token System Overhaul

- **Shape System**: Replaced `BoxDecoration` with `ShapeDecoration` across the example app for better semantics. Introduced `M3BorderRadius` and converted `M3Radius` from `double` to `Radius` constants, providing a more robust and type-safe way to define shapes.
- **Motion Tokens**: Consolidated motion-related tokens. `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` have been merged into a single, more organized `m3_motion.dart` file under the `sys` directory, improving clarity and discoverability.
- **File Structure**: Reorganized the token file structure to better align with the Material Design 3 system. Legacy and unused token files like `M3ColorRoles`, `m3_radius.dart` (the old `double` based one), and `m3_examples.dart` have been removed to streamline the package.

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed `M3ColorRoles`**: The static `M3ColorRoles` class has been removed. Please use the color scheme provided by the `M3Theme` or `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for semantic color access.
- **Removed `M3Radius` (as `double`)**: The `M3Radius` class that provided `double` values has been replaced by `M3BorderRadius` (which provides `BorderRadius` objects) and a new `M3Radius` class that provides `Radius` objects.
- **Consolidated Motion Tokens**: `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` are no longer separate files. Import `package:material_design/material_design.dart` and use the `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` classes directly.

### Enhancements & Fixes

- **Code Cleanup**: Performed a general code cleanup, removing obsolete files and refactoring the example app for better readability and consistency.
- **Shape Implementation**: Consistently replaced `BorderRadius.circular()` with the new `M3BorderRadius` constants throughout the example app.
- **New `md` Module**: Introduced a new `md` module for future development, starting with a new barrel file `md.dart`.
