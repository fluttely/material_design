# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adherves to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.10.0

### üí• BREAKING CHANGES

- **Major Token System Refactor**: The token system has been significantly refactored to improve consistency, remove redundancy, and align more closely with a unified design system architecture.
  - **Unified Shape Tokens**: `M3BorderRadiusToken` and `M3RadiusToken` are now internal (`_M3BorderRadiusToken`, `_M3RadiusToken`). All shape properties should be accessed directly through `M3ShapeToken`.
    - **Before**: `M3BorderRadiusToken.medium.value`
    - **After**: `M3ShapeToken.medium.borderRadius`
  - **Screen Size Enum Renamed**: `M3WindowSizeClass` has been renamed to `M3ScreenSize` for better clarity and to avoid conflicts with Flutter's own window size classes.
  - **Private Component/State Tokens**: `M3ComponentElevationToken` and `M3StateElevationToken` have been made private (`_M3ComponentElevationToken`, `_M3StateElevationToken`) as they are intended for internal use within the system.
  - **Simplified Motion API**: `M3MotionToken` now includes `duration` and `easing` getters, simplifying animation definitions.

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- **Improved API Consistency**: The token API is now more consistent and predictable. Accessing related values (like radius from a shape) is more intuitive.
- **Streamlined Architecture**: By removing redundant and reference-level tokens, the public API is smaller, cleaner, and easier to learn.
- **Enhanced Readability**: The new patterns (`M3ShapeToken.medium.borderRadius`) make the code more declarative and easier to read.

### üóëÔ∏è Deprecations & Removals

- **Removed Reference Tokens**: The `M3Ref...` token files (`M3RefPalette`, `M3RefOpacity`, `M3RefTypeface`) have been removed from the public API. Their values are now integrated directly into the system tokens where needed.
- **Removed Component-Specific Button Tokens**: `M3CompButton` has been removed. Use standard Flutter `ButtonStyle` with system tokens for customization.
- **Removed `M3ColorSchemeToken`**: This has been removed as part of the color system simplification. Use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for semantic color access.
- **Removed Demo Component Showcase**: The `components_showcase_page.dart` file has been deleted from the demo application as part of a broader demo simplification effort.

### üîß Migration Guide

**Shape and Radius:**

Update all references to `M3BorderRadiusToken` to use the new `M3ShapeToken` accessors.

**Before (v0.9.2):**
```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    borderRadius: M3BorderRadiusToken.medium.value,
  ),
)
```

**After (v0.10.0):**
```dart
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    borderRadius: M3ShapeToken.medium.borderRadius,
  ),
)
```

**Adaptive Layouts:**

**Before (v0.9.2):**
```dart
final sizeClass = M3BreakpointToken.getWindowSizeClassFromContext(context);
if (sizeClass == M3WindowSizeClass.compact) {
  // ...
}
```

**After (v0.10.0):**
```dart
final sizeClass = M3BreakpointToken.getWindowSizeClassFromContext(context);
if (sizeClass == M3ScreenSize.compact) {
  // ...
}

## 0.6.2

### Major Refactoring: Token System Overhaul

- **Shape System**: Replaced `BoxDecoration` with `ShapeDecoration` across the example app for better semantics. Introduced `M3BorderRadius` and converted `M3Radius` from `double` to `Radius` constants, providing a more robust and type-safe way to define shapes.
- **Motion Tokens**: Consolidated motion-related tokens. `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` have been merged into a single, more organized `m3_motion.dart` file under the `sys` directory, improving clarity and discoverability.
- **File Structure**: Reorganized the token file structure to better align with the Material Design 3 system. Legacy and unused token files like `M3ColorRoles`, `m3_radius.dart` (the old `double` based one), and `m3_examples.dart` have been removed to streamline the package.

### Breaking Changes

- **Removed `M3ColorRoles`**: The static `M3ColorRoles` class has been removed. Please use the color scheme provided by the `M3Theme` or `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for semantic color access.
- **Removed `M3Radius` (as `double`)**: The `M3Radius` class that provided `double` values has been replaced by `M3BorderRadius` (which provides `BorderRadius` objects) and a new `M3Radius` class that provides `Radius` objects.
- **Consolidated Motion Tokens**: `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` are no longer separate files. Import `package:material_design/material_design.dart` and use the `M3MotionDuration` and `M3MotionEasing` classes directly.

### Enhancements & Fixes

- **Code Cleanup**: Performed a general code cleanup, removing obsolete files and refactoring the example app for better readability and consistency.
- **Shape Implementation**: Consistently replaced `BorderRadius.circular()` with the new `M3BorderRadius` constants throughout the example app.
- **New `md` Module**: Introduced a new `md` module for future development, starting with a new barrel file `md.dart`.

## 0.6.1

### Refinements and Internationalization

- **Refactored README**: Simplified the documentation to focus on core features and improve clarity.
- **Internationalized Example App**: All user-facing strings in the accessibility showcase are now in English, making the example more accessible to a global audience.
- **Code Cleanup**: Minor code cleanup and refactoring in the example app for better readability and maintenance.

## 0.6.0

### New Features

- **Complete M3 Theme System**: Introduced `M3Theme`, an integrated theme builder that generates a complete `ThemeData` from a seed color, with full support for light, dark, and high-contrast modes.
- **Comprehensive Accessibility Utilities**: Added the `M3Accessibility` class, providing a suite of tools for building WCAG-compliant UIs, including accessible form fields, focus indicators, contrast checking, and touch target enforcement.
- **Adaptive Design System**: Implemented the `M3Adaptive` class with helpers for responsive layouts (`M3Adaptive.responsiveLayout`), adaptive navigation (`M3AdaptiveScaffold`), and adaptive components that adjust to different screen sizes and platforms.
- **Advanced Token Utilities**: Added new utility classes for enhanced token functionality:
  - `M3TypeScale`: Responsive and accessible typography helpers.
  - `M3ColorUtils`: Color manipulation and contrast validation.
  - `M3ShapeUtils`: Responsive and brand-specific shape generation.
  - `M3MotionUtils`: Contextual animation patterns (fade, slide, scale).

### Breaking Changes

- **Token Architecture Refactor**: The entire token system has been restructured to follow the official Material Design 3 hierarchy:
  - **Reference Tokens (Ref)**: Foundational values (e.g., `M3RefPalette`, `M3RefDuration`).
  - **System Tokens (Sys)**: Semantic roles (e.g., `M3SysColor`).
  - **Component Tokens (Comp)**: Component-specific values (e.g., `M3CompButton`).
- The old token structure is now considered legacy and will be deprecated in a future version.

### Enhancements & Fixes

- **Example App Overhaul**: The example app has been completely reorganized into `Foundations`, `Styles`, and `Components` sections to provide a comprehensive showcase of all new features and the new token architecture.
- **Documentation**: Massively updated `README.md` and added `ENHANCED_FEATURES.md` to document the new capabilities.
- **Code Quality**: Refactored numerous widgets and classes for better organization, consistency, and adherence to M3 specifications.

## 0.5.1

- **BREAKING**: Renamed `M3Margins` to `M3Margin` and `M3Spacers` to `M3Spacer` for better naming consistency.
- **DOCS**: Updated `README.md` to reflect the new class names and provide clearer examples.
- **CHORE**: Updated the example app to use the new `M3Margin` and `M3Spacer` classes.

## 0.5.0
